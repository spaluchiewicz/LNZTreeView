                   This is a swift implementation for iOS of a Tree View. A Tree View is a graphical representation of a tree. Each element (node) can have a number of sub elements (children).

                   This particular implementation of TreeView organizes nodes and subnodes in rows and each node has an indentation that indicates the hierarchy of the element. A parent can be expanded or collapsed and each children can be a parent itself containing more sub nodes.
